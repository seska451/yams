# YAMS - Yet Another Mission Script - DCS World

Mission scripting in DCS beyond anything fairly simple only leaves you with a handful of options these days, and those options dont really open the world of scripting to you. They can be difficult to understand because the documentation is hard to navigate. 

# Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a mission scripter a well documented set of tools with up to date examples, even if that set of tools is small to begin with.

Rather than solve every problem, the problems that get solved, should...

1. Be well documented, with clear examples
2. Have a low barrier to entry to achieve the goal of the feature
3. Yield a consistent syntax that allows the editor to fall into the 'pit of success' as much as possible
